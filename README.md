# AI Job Impact Analysis: Is AI a Job Killer or Recruiter?

## Description
This project analyzes the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the job market, exploring whether AI displaces jobs or creates new opportunities. Through data analysis and visualizations, it provides insights into AI adoption across industries, the shifting demand for job roles and skills, worker perceptions, and future job market projections.

## Features / Highlights
- Analysis of AI adoption across various industries  
- Assessment of AI’s impact on routine vs. creative job roles  
- Identification of in-demand skills in an AI-driven economy  
- Survey insights on worker perceptions of AI  
- Projections showing net positive job impact with AI adoption  
- Visual storytelling combining Jupyter Notebook and Power BI  

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI Desktop  
- Git & GitHub  

## Files Included
- `project_notebook.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and narrative  
- `AI_Job_Impact.pbix` — Power BI report file (if applicable)  
- `data/` — Folder containing datasets used (if any)  
- `README.md` — This documentation file

## How to View and Run
- Open `project_notebook.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the analysis and story.  
- Open `AI_Job_Impact.pbix` with Power BI Desktop to interact with the visual dashboard.

## Conclusion
The data suggests that while AI may disrupt routine jobs in the short term, it ultimately acts as a job transformer rather than a pure job killer. New opportunities in AI development, data science, and human-AI collaboration are expected to emerge. Preparing for this future requires upskilling and embracing AI as a productivity tool.
